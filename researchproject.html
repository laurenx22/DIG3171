  <h1>My Final Research Project</h1>
  <p> Chatbot: <a href="https://share.chatling.ai/s/Jfq8E9XYcbuEgSg">Chatling</a>  <br><br> Click the link to learn more about Climate Change! </p>

<h1>Abstract</h1>

<p>What if there was a simple tool that could help people better understand their role
in climate change on the planet? Climate change is a particularly important topic, yet
many people lack knowledge to really understand what is happening. Fizaine and Le
Borgne argue that greater climate knowledge significantly reduces individual carbon
footprints (Fizaine and Le Borgne 1). An easy-to-use educational tool that people can use
to help their understanding of climate change is the first step in helping people reduce
their carbon footprint.
<br><br>
This project will use Chatling to create an educational chatbot that will inform users
about climate change and how some of their daily choices contribute to their carbon
footprint. Users will learn through a conversation-based learning tool which can make this
educational experience more accessible and personalized. The perspective that climate
change is not only a physical problem, but a cultural problem is a key argument for having
the chatbot not only understand the science of climate change but connecting it to people
and their lives (Sörlin and Lane 6).
<br><br>
One key finding was that you can reduce your household emissions in remarkably
simple lifestyle adjustments. You can make a difference with several minor changes
without needing to do anything super drastic that would change your current lifestyle
(Jones and Kammen). Another key finding was that there are tools like carbon footprint
tracking apps that can help show users their carbon footprint and suggest areas that need
improvement (Lasarov et al). Similarly, there are also carbon calculators that can motivate
users to reduce their carbon footprint based on financial reasons (Enlund et al). This can
make users aware of their spending habits that lead to bigger carbon footprints and
suggest areas where they can make beneficial swaps.
<br><br>
By creating a tool that allows users to gain an understanding of climate change and
their carbon footprint, it is a starting point for better climate literacy. When we have better
climate literacy then we start making real changes in the very real problem, climate
change. This learning tool will help educate and empower individuals to create a positive
change for our future.
