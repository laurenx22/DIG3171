<h1>Hi, I'm Lauren!</h1>
<p> I am a Digital Media major on a Web & Social Platforms track. I currently have a job with Lunar-VISE, a research lab at UCF. I am part of their communications team and do their social media. I have experience with social media content ​creation, social media management, 
    photography, photo editing, and video editing. I ​would love to help produce content for or run social media accounts for sports teams, ​musicians/bands, films, or any company that I really enjoy. Specifically, I would love to ​record or edit videos ​
    posted to socials, or overall, manage the social media accounts. </p>
