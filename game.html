  <h1> Abstract </h1>
  <p>This Bitsy game centers on climate change, with a focus on rising sea levels. Its purpose is to help players better understand the impacts of this issue through intergenerational perspectives. As a marina 
    worker, the player encounters their grandparent reflecting on changes over time, their boss discussing the effects on their livelihood, a scientist sharing factual insights, and a child voicing concerns about 
    the future. By presenting these diverse viewpoints, the game aims to deepen awareness of sea level rise and inspire interest in climate change protections.</p>
