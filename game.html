  <h1> Abstract </h1>
  <p>This is a Bitsy game centered around climate change. Specifically, it talks about sea levels rising. You are playing a worker at a marina, your grandparent mentions how they've seen change over their lifetime, your boss says how it impacts their life, you hear facts from a scientist, and you hear from a child worried about their future.</p>
