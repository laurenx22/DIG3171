<p> Above is a link to my Bitsy game. Click the link to play! </p>

  <h1> Abstract </h1>
  <p>This is a Bitsy game centered around climate change. Specifically, it talks about sea levels rising. The purpose of this is for the player to learn more about the impact of rising sea levels. 
    As you play, you learn about the impacts through meeting characters of different generations. You are playing a worker at a marina, your grandparent mentions how they've seen change over their lifetime, 
    your boss says how it impacts their life, you hear facts from a scientist, and you hear from a child worried about their future. The takeaway from playing the Bitsy game is to hopefully have a better 
    understanding of the impacts of rising sea levels and hopefully spark an interest in climate change protections.</p>
